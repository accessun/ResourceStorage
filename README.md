# ResourceStorage

This repository is for personal use only.

Resources like pictures which are used in my markdown notes are stored in this repository.

### Memo

- `RenameAndMove-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`: Java program that renames all the picture files (png, jpg, and jpeg) in this directory using UUID and moves these renamed files to `pictures`
- `renameAndPushPics.sh`: the bash script to trigger the execution of `RenameAndMove-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- `source`: the source code of the Java program and POM file are contained in this directory for reference
